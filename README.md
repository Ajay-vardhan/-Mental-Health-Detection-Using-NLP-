# üß† Mental Health Detection Using NLP

This repository contains multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches for **multi-class mental health status detection** based on user text data.  
Our models can classify text into **7 categories**:
- Anxiety
- Bipolar
- Depression
- Normal
- Personality Disorder
- Stress
- Suicidal

## üìä Dataset
The dataset consists of user-generated statements related to mental health, labeled into 7 categories.  
Before training, we:
- Removed stopwords, URLs, and special characters.
- Balanced the dataset to reduce class imbalance.
- Tokenized and padded sequences for deep learning models.

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We performed:
- **Class distribution analysis** (bar & pie charts)
- **Word clouds** for each class
- **Text length distribution**
- **Most frequent words per category**
